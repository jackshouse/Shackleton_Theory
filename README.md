# Shackleton_Theory
The Shackleton Theory is a groundbreaking approach to space-time physics that redefine time as a dynamic and navigable force rather than a passive parameter. This project aims to dvelop a structed, scientific, and computational framework to explore time geodesics, time currents, and engineered time manipulation.
